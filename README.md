# Note-Taker

## Description

In this project, I created a note taker application, which implements express.js to create a backend server. This application allows the user to to add and delete notes from a list. The application has a homepage with a "Get Started" button that takes the user to a note taking page. There the user can create a title and content for the note, and then press the save button in the top right of the page to generate a saved note on the left third of the page. The user can then delete a note by pressing the red trash can button next to the saved note.
